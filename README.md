# Neuron
> A CUDA boosted CNN implementation from scratch

I used weather data (temperature, pression, rain, wind ...) to build and test my neural network.

Thereafter a gif pointing out the training session (each image are separated by 1000 epochs)

The result (orange) on weather temperature data (blue)

![Result!](https://github.com/MaximeAeva/Neuron/blob/master/res/solution.png)

This neural network can predict temperature within an interval below +- 2°C.

## Installation
Windows:

```console
git clone
```
Then run train.py will train different network architecture until it find one below your specified accuracy.
CUDA neural network is not complete for now (in fact, neural network is, but CNN isn't).
Tests tend to forecast a x30 computational speed improvement !

## Usage example

Split data into classes

## Release History

*0.0.0
|   Rebuild the github (started the project last year where github was out of my scope)
