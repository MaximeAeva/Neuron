# About Files

## ActivationsFunctions
    Every numpy based activation functions (relu, sigmoid ...)

## Display
    Networkx based neural network architecture display
    It also display strenght of weights between nodes (only for classical NN)

## Functions
    Every functions to build a numpy based NN (Should be up to build a CNN also)

## NeuralActivation
    CUDA based activations functions

## NeuralFunctions
    Every functions to build a CUDA based CNN including:
    Adam optimizer, 
    he parameters initialization,
    Dropout learning,
    Standardised weights,
    Random shuffled mini batches

## Scrapper
    Everything that I used to create a weather database

## Train
    A running algorithm to randomly generate NN architecture and 
    find one that satisfy the criterion before.
    It also prevent overfitting by aborting training if the derivative 
    from the log of the cost function is to low
